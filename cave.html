          <p>In 1943, while the world was at war, I had a vision. Aperture Science was born-a behemoth of innovation, pushing the boundaries of science. Failure was merely a stepping stone on our path to success.</p>
          <p>We defied conventions, broke barriers, and left a trail of marvels. From the Enrichment Center to GLaDOS, we dared to dream and forever changed the face of science.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cavetextdiv">
          <p> you might know us as a vital participant in the 1968 Senate Hearings on missing astronauts. And you've most likely used one of the many products we invented. But that other people have somehow managed to steal from us.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cavetextdiv">
          <p>Listen up, folks. I have a bone to pick with those sly devils over at Black Mesa. You see, they claim to be all about scientific progress, but let me tell you, they've got a knack for snatching up ideas right from under my nose. It's like they're taking a stroll through my brain, picking out the best concepts and calling them their own.

            Now, I've got nothing against competition—keeps the fires burning, you know—but there's something downright irritating about someone riding on your coattails without so much as a nod of acknowledgement. I've spent years refining and perfecting my scientific marvels, only to see Black Mesa swoop in, replicate them, and pretend they came up with it all on their own.
            
            They think they can just waltz into the world of scientific innovation and claim the glory for themselves. Well, let me tell you, I've got a few choice words for those copycats. I won't stand idly by while they parade around with my ideas as if they were their own stroke of genius.
            
            So, Black Mesa, you may have the resources and the manpower, but mark my words: I'll always be one step ahead. And when it comes to true innovation and groundbreaking discoveries, you'll never hold a candle to the brilliance of Cave Johnson.</p>
